# cottonhouseloftswebsite

In 2010 I built this website for the Cottonhouse Lofts in Lowell, Massachusetts. It was also my final project for a beginning Web Development class. (Obviously not a _Design_ class... look at that font, geesh.)

The site is no longer live, but you can view the archive here:
