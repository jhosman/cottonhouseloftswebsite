<p><span class="enfemph">Whereas</span> the Declaration of Trust for the Upper Cotton House Lofts Condominium Association specifies a set of Rules and Regulations for the Owners; and</p>
<p><span class="enfemph">Whereas</span> the Declaration of Trust for the Upper Cotton House Lofts Condominium Association allows the Trustees to amend those Rules and Regulations; and</p>
